# Portfolio Project: Task Management System

This project represents a simple task management system where users can create, view, edit, and delete tasks. The primary goal of this project is to demonstrate a working knowledge of modern software engineering principles with a focus on DevOps practices.

## Project Requirements

- Users should be able to register, log in, and log out.
- Only authenticated users should be able to create, view, edit, or delete tasks.
- Tasks should have a title, description, creation date, and completion date.
- The system should be deployed in a containerized environment using Docker.
- The system should implement CI/CD practices using GitHub actions.

## Technologies Used

- **Django**: A high-level Python Web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design.
- **PostgreSQL**: An open-source relational database.
- **Docker**: A platform to develop, ship, and run applications inside containers.
- **GitHub Actions**: A platform for CI/CD and other workflows.
