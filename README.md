# Portfolio Project: Task Management System

## Project Description

This project is a Task Management System developed as a part of the "Modern Software Engineering with DevOps" course. It is designed to allow users to manage tasks effectively by adding, updating, deleting, and viewing them. Additionally, it provides user authentication features like registration, login, and logout. 

The application is built using the Django framework, ensuring a robust backend. The frontend relies on Django's templating engine, providing an intuitive user interface that interacts with the Django models and views.
